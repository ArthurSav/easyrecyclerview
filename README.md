# Easy Recyclerview
The fastest way to use a recyclerview. Create a damn list with (almost)one line of code.

#Set up
Add jitpack to your sources, like so:

```
repositories {
	    maven {
	        url "https://jitpack.io"
	    }
	}
```



And this to your dependencies:

```
dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.c0nnector:easyrecyclerview:1.6.5'
	}
```
